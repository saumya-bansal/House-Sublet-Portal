House sublet portal

Sasa Sublets is a United states based house sublet portal mainly aimed for university students.
This portal is a flask application that is hosted on Kubernetes using Docker. It is deployed on Google Cloud and uses PostGreSQL as database.
The following are the features of the portal:
- The house sublease system will enable users to sublease houses without an intermediate broker.
-	Users will be able to create and sublet their houses, apartments, condos or townhouses.
-	Users will be able to browse and filter the listings based on housing type, address, start date, end date, price, area, number of beds and baths, number of occupants, etc
-	Users will be able to filter results based on proximity to certain amenities like:
--	Universities
--	Marketplaces
--	Cafes
--	Bicycle rentals

As soon as a house gets subleased, the sublessee receives a confirmation mail.
